            To <br />
            The Secretary,<br />

            Union Government of India,<br />

        <p>Dear Sir,</p>
        <p>
            This is in reference to the draft EIA notification, 2020 which has been uploaded on the environment
            ministry’s website on 12 March 2020 seeking public comments within sixty days of the issuance of the
            notification. I am deeply concerned that this draft notification has been put out in the midst of a
            national health crisis. This makes it impossible to understand and discuss the implications of the proposed
            amendments. I cannot help but view this haste with suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having read the amendmends in the above mentioned notification, I strongly oppose the draft Environment
            Impact Assessment Notification, 2020, and request you to withdraw the same. This proposed modification of
            the EIA policy of 2006 is by far the most serious and long lasting blow to protection of the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The EIA Policy is framed under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986. Section 3(1) of the Act states that
            “the Central Government shall have the power to take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient
            for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and
            abating environmental pollution.” The new EIA policy does nothing of the kind. It purports to impose
            ‘certain restrictions and prohibition’ on development projects and to make the process of granting
            environment clearance ‘more transparent and expedient’.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it is clear that what the amended policy really intends to do is to considerably dilute the
            existing process of granting environment clearances and to prevent any public scrutiny of the project
            proponents’ actions. Many of the changes have, in fact, been proposed to circumvent the past decisions of
            the National Green Tribunal and the Courts. Some of the more serious concerns that the proposed EIA policy
            has are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grant of post facto approval to projects which may have started, or increased in size, without prior
                environmental clearance, on payment of a penalty. This makes nonsense of the requirement of prior
                clearance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reclassifying projects and activities to put several polluting ones such as thermal power, cement and
                chemical fertilizer plants into a category (B2) which require minimal scrutiny.
            </li>
            <li>
                Excluding the need for public consultation for a number of projects where such consultation was earlier
                necessary – this includes all building, construction and area development projects, and anything
                declared ‘strategic’ by the government.
            </li>
            <li>
                Where such consultation is still necessary, reducing the time available to the public to make objections
            </li>
            <li>
                Specifying that no reports regarding violation of the conditions of environmental clearance will be
                entertained from anyone other than the project proponent or a government authority.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increased validity of the environment clearance for mining projects and river valley projects from 30
                years currently to 50 years and, 10 years currently to 15 years respectively, thus increasing the risk
                of irreversible environmental, social, and health consequences on account of the project remaining
                unnoticed for long.
            </li>
            <li>
                Specifying that the industries need provide only an annual environmental compliance report rather
                than half-yearly reports. Past experiences show that industries have continued to provide data that are
                false and inaccurate. Seeking an annual report provides an opportunity for the industries to further
                underestimate any socio-environmental issues arising in their projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That the government was not really interested in getting responses from the public on the draft EIA Policy
            2020, or acting on them, is obvious from the fact that the draft notification was available only in English
            and Hindi and was only on the Ministry’s website until 30 June, and, despite requests that more time should
            be given for responses, due to the ongoing pandemic, no heed was paid to such requests. It was only when the
            Court stepped in that the last date for receiving responses was extended from 30 June to 11 August 2020 and
            the draft policy was directed to be made available in 22 languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The model of development the government wishes to follow has little to do with the principles of sustainable
            development. Development has come to mean a manic frenzy of activity, resulting in the depletion and
            pollution of rivers and water bodies, ravaging of oceans and coasts, and the wanton cutting down of forests;
            Local bodies and those whose very survival depend on such forests, oceans, coasts and natural wealth are
            rarely consulted. This perverse growth has been fuelled by a nexus between governments, both at the Centre
            and the States, political parties, big corporates and the contracting oligarchs. It is becoming increasingly
            evident that safeguarding the interests of this nexus is more important than conserving our natural
            heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our nation will be a victim of the devastating effects of this twisted and diluted EIA draft, if it comes
            into act. The right to a clean, green and healthy environment is a part of our Fundamental Rights under
            Article 21 of the Constitution; and the dilution of regulations, policies and procedures aimed at protecting
            the environment contravenes these rights. Protecting the environment is also a part of the Directive
            Principles of State Policy under Article 48-A and the Fundamental Duties of all citizens under Article
            51-A(g).
        </p>
        <p>
            We urge you to withdraw the proposed EIA Policy 2020 altogether and replace it with a more sensitive policy,
            which is people and habitat friendly.
        </p>

        Yours Sincerely,
